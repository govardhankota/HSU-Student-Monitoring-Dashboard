        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>
          The HSU Student Monitoring Dashboard is an integrated, data-driven
          solution designed to support universities in understanding and improving
          student success. Across higher education, institutions struggle with
          fragmented data spread across academic, housing, financial, and
          engagement systems, making it difficult for advisors to identify students
          who may be at risk. This project addresses that challenge by creating a
          unified platform that consolidates all student information into an
          interactive, analytics-focused dashboard.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using a structured ETL pipeline in Power Query and a star-schema data
          model, the system merges academic performance metrics, financial
          standing, housing indicators, and co-curricular engagement. These
          datasets are transformed into a FactStudent table and multiple supporting
          dimensions, enabling deep analysis and drill-down capabilities. A set of
          DAX-based KPIs—including risk score, attendance trends, academic flags,
          engagement levels, and financial compliance—forms the core of the
          analytics engine.
        </p>
        <p>
          The final Power BI dashboard presents two main reporting views: a
          Students Overview Page that summarizes risk levels across the campus,
          and a Student Details Page offering a 360-degree profile for each
          individual student. Together, these insights support academic advisors,
          program coordinators, and student support staff in making data-informed
          decisions and strengthening institutional retention strategies.

    <section id="problem">
      <div class="section-card">
        <h2>Problem Context &amp; Stakeholders</h2>
        <p>
          Universities generate large volumes of student data across multiple
          departments, but these systems often operate in isolation. Advisors
          receive academic updates separately from financial alerts, housing
          concerns, or engagement data. This fragmented approach makes it
          difficult to identify students who may be struggling, resulting in
          delayed interventions and potential student dropouts.
        </p>

        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <ul class="key-points">
          <li>Student data is siloed across academic, financial, housing, and engagement systems.</li>
          <li>Advisors lack a unified view of student progress and challenges.</li>
          <li>Manual reporting leads to delays, inconsistency, and missed signals.</li>
          <li>Institutions need early-warning indicators to improve retention.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Stakeholders</h3>
        <ul class="key-points">
          <li><strong>Students</strong> – Receive timely, targeted support and reduced academic risk.</li>
          <li><strong>Academic Advisors</strong> – Need a 360° view of each student’s situation.</li>
          <li><strong>Student Success Offices</strong> – Monitor risk levels and intervention outcomes.</li>
          <li><strong>Financial Services</strong> – Track balances, aid eligibility, and compliance.</li>
          <li><strong>Housing Staff</strong> – Understand conflicts, housing stability, and residency engagement.</li>
          <li><strong>University Leadership</strong> – Use aggregated insights to guide policy and resource allocation.</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- ============ RESEARCH & INSIGHTS ============ -->
    <section id="research">
      <div class="section-card">
        <h2>Research &amp; Insights</h2>
        <p>
          Research in higher education analytics highlights that early
          identification of at-risk students is critical for improving retention
          and completion rates. Studies show that monitoring GPA, attendance, and
          engagement patterns can significantly improve the effectiveness of
          academic advising and support programs.
        </p>
        <p>
          The literature also emphasizes that single-domain indicators are
          insufficient. Combining academic performance, financial stress, housing
          stability, and engagement provides a more accurate picture of student
          success. Institutions increasingly rely on predictive analytics and
          dashboards to operationalize this multi-dimensional view.
        </p>
        <p>
          These findings informed the design of the HSU Student Monitoring
          Dashboard in several ways: the model includes features from all four
          domains, calculates a composite risk score, and allows advisors to drill
          down into detailed student histories. The solution aligns with practices
          used in commercial student-success platforms while remaining adaptable
          to HSU’s specific needs and data environment.

    <!-- ============ PROPOSED SOLUTION ============ -->
    <section id="solution">
      <div class="section-card">
        <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
        <p>
          The proposed solution is a unified Power BI–based analytics platform
          that consolidates student data from Academic, Finance, Housing, and
          Engagement systems into an integrated monitoring dashboard. Advisors and
          student support staff can quickly scan campus-wide trends and then
          drill into individual student profiles when risk indicators appear.
        </p>

        <h3>Key Features</h3>
        <ul class="key-points">
          <li>360° student profiles combining academic, financial, housing, and engagement metrics.</li>
          <li>A DAX-based composite <strong>risk score</strong> and <strong>risk banding</strong> (low, medium, high).</li>
          <li>Early-warning indicators for GPA drops, attendance issues, or financial non-compliance.</li>
          <li>Two interactive dashboards: Students Overview and Student Detail.</li>
          <li>Row-level security (RLS) to restrict access to students assigned to specific advisors.</li>
          <li>Filterable views by term, program, risk level, and engagement status.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This solution modernizes advising workflows by replacing manual reports
          with dynamic, visually rich dashboards that highlight where attention is
          needed most.

            <h3>Enterprise Architecture</h3>
            <p>
              The HSU Student Monitoring Dashboard uses a layered architecture that
              separates data ingestion, transformation, storage, analytics, and
              presentation. Data from Academic, Finance, Housing, and Engagement
              systems flows through an integration layer into a central data model,
              which is then surfaced through interactive Power BI dashboards.

              Engagement, and Housing tables reference it through foreign keys.
              This structure reduces redundancy and supports flexible analysis in

          The <strong>Students Overview Page</strong> highlights campus-wide trends,

          The <strong>Student Detail Page</strong> provides a 360° profile of a

        <h2>Lessons Learned &amp; Team Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          Building the HSU Student Monitoring Dashboard strengthened our ability to
          translate a real higher-education challenge into a practical analytics
          solution. We learned how important it is to define consistent keys,
          design a coherent data model, and validate metrics against realistic
          scenarios before creating visualizations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Technically, the project deepened our skills in Power Query, data
          modeling, DAX, and dashboard storytelling. We also gained experience
          balancing detail and usability—deciding which metrics belong in an
          overview versus a drill-through page, and how to present risk in a way
          that is actionable rather than overwhelming.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a team, we improved our collaboration, documentation, and version
          control practices. The project provided a valuable preview of how
          data-driven tools can support student success initiatives in real
          institutions and helped us develop a portfolio-ready artifact that
          reflects our interests in analytics and education technology.
